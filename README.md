# Image-Plane Correction

This is a repository containing code/algorithms for image-plane correction, intended for use with the OVRO-LWA radio telescope.
This research is being performed by Zachary Huang as part of Caltech's 2024 SURF program (under the mentorship of Casey Law, Gregg Hallinan, and others).
