# Image-Plane Correction

This is a repository containing code/algorithms for image-plane correction, intended for use with the OVRO-LWA radio telescope.
This research is being performed by Zachary Huang as part of Caltech's 2024 SURF program (under the mentorship of Casey Law, Gregg Hallinan, and others).

# Development

All of the project dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml`.
To install all of these dependencies, enter the project directory and run `pip install .`.
If you wish to run the notebooks in `notebooks/`, I would recommend using Jupyter Lab (which you can install along with the project dependencies with `pip install .[dev]`.
